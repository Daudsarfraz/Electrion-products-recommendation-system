# Recommendation System for Electronics Dataset

## Overview
This project involves building a recommendation system using the **Amazon Electronics dataset** to predict and suggest products based on user behavior, product metadata, and contextual information. The goal is to recommend relevant products to users, enhancing the user experience and engagement on e-commerce platforms.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the **Amazon Electronics dataset**, which is part of the Amazon Reviews data available [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). The dataset contains:

- **Rows**: 7,824,482
- **Size**: 320 MB

### Columns:
- **UserId**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **ProductId**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Rating**: Rating given by the user to the corresponding product.
- **Timestamp**: Time when the rating was given.

## Techniques Used

The following techniques were implemented to build the recommendation system:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: A technique that recommends items based on similarities between users or items, derived from the user-item interactions.
2. **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends items based on the features of the items and the userâ€™s past behavior (e.g., genre, author).
3. **Matrix Factorization**: A type of collaborative filtering that identifies latent factors influencing user preferences.
4. **Hybrid Methods**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques to improve the quality and diversity of recommendations.

## Libraries & Methods Used
To implement these techniques, the following libraries and methods were used:

- **KNNWithMeans**
- **SVD**
- **SVDpp**
- **KNNBaseline**
- **KNNBasic**
- **KNNWithZScore**
- **BaselineOnly**
- **crossvalidate**
- **KFold**
- **GridSearchCV**

These methods were implemented to tune hyperparameters and cross-validate the models, ensuring high accuracy and optimal performance.

## Data Sources for Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems rely on large datasets to make accurate predictions. These datasets can consist of:

- **User Behavior Data**: Interactions such as clicks, purchases, ratings, and reviews.
- **Item Metadata**: Information such as title, genre, release date, etc., for items like movies or books.
- **User Demographics**: Data like age, gender, location, and occupation of users.
- **Contextual Information**: External factors that influence preferences, such as time of day, weather, or social context.

## How the System Works

The recommendation system makes suggestions using several techniques:

1. **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has interacted with previously.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies similar users and recommends items that other similar users have liked.
3. **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors that represent the relationship between users and items.
4. **Hybrid Methods**: Combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.

## Conclusion

This recommendation system is designed to enhance user experience by offering personalized suggestions based on user behavior and item metadata. The system combines multiple techniques to ensure that recommendations are both relevant and diverse, helping users discover new products more efficiently.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporating additional contextual information like time of day, weather, etc., to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- Expanding the system to include more data sources, such as social media data or external reviews.
- Experimenting with more advanced techniques like deep learning-based recommendation systems.
